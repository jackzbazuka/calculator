# Tkinter GUI Calculator

An elementary mathematical calculator made with Tkinter as a learning project for course **GUI using python**. I made this parallel to learning basics of Tkinter. I've used the grid layout while placing the widgets on the frame and for some reason the "bg" attribute for widgets doesn't work on mac, so I've used "highlightbackground" attribute in there to color the background of widgets.

### Issues

* This is not a scientific calculator but I'd like to make it one.
* I've only covered the ZeroDivisionError and not any other exceptions present in there, but feel free to commit if you find one.
